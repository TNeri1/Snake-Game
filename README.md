# Snake-Game

### Purpose:

* Follow tutorial to learn how to build 'Snake', maintain knowledge and logic of software development in JavaScript, and work on extra additions for the game.

### What Have I Learned:

* First, I learned that there was so much more to 'Snake' than I thought.
* I learned about Linear Algebra and about working with and implementing Vectors
* I thought I knew vectors after my Data Structures class but building this game has taught me so much more about Vectors especialy segments and using them to be able to grown the snake, change directions, move the snake, apply state, and check for boundaries in the game.
* I learned to not just copy code but actually dive into the logic of every function to understand what each function was trying to accomplish
* I get to build a pretty cool game besides the ones I built for Object-Oriented Programming class: Moon Lander, Skeet, Asteroids
